A Photo and Video-Sharing Social Media Platform
Designed a geo-based social network with React JS framework.

1. Implemented token-based registration/login/logout flow with React Router v4 and user authentication with JWT.
2. Used Ant Design, Geolocation API and Google Map API for users to create, browse posts and search nearby posts.
3. Deployed web service to Google Cloud to handle posts and used Elasticsearch (GCE) to provide geo-location based search functions (can search nearby posts within a distance).
4. Provided a face detection by Google Cloud Vision API to predict faces in uploaded posts.
